# BEW-Contractor-Project



The product I will build is an application for buying and selling professionally refurbished phones. A large amount of people nowadays do not want to purchase the newest and best products, the old products still work for them and they don’t see any value in purchasing the latest and greatest technology. This application will allow users to browse through phones and essentially get a “PhoneFax” for each phone, along with the ability to purchase the phones. Users will also be able to upload refurbished phones to sell if they are certified professionals. This will help with connecting users to reliable sources for cheap, refurbished phones.
